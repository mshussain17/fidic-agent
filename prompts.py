DOCUMENT_DESCRIBE_PROMPT = """You will be given a document text. Your task is to create a concise summary of this text that can be used as a tool description for a retriever tool. This summary will help an AI language model determine whether a user's question is related to the content of the document.

Here is the document text:
<document>
{DOCUMENT_TEXT}
</document>

To create an effective summary for the retriever tool description, follow these guidelines:

1. Read the entire document carefully to understand its main topics and key points.

2. Identify the most important information that would be relevant for determining whether a user's question is related to this document.

3. Create a concise summary (around 2-3 sentences) that captures the essence of the document's content. Focus on:
   - The main subject or topic of the document
   - Key themes or concepts discussed
   - Any specific areas of focus or expertise covered

4. Use clear and straightforward language. Avoid jargon or overly technical terms unless they are essential to understanding the document's content.

5. Do not include:
   - Detailed examples or case studies
   - Specific data points or statistics
   - Personal opinions or interpretations of the content

6. Ensure that your summary is general enough to cover the broad topics of the document, but specific enough to distinguish it from documents on similar subjects.

Write your summary within <summary> tags. Remember, the goal is to create a description that will help an AI determine if a user's question is likely to be answered by the content of this document.
